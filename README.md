##The Mustache Game
==================

The mustache game is a [popular drinking game](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/27/mustache-movie-drinking-game_n_1833447.html) in which mustaches are affixed to a TV screen and the players drink whenever someone on screen aligns with the mustache.  

The object of this extension is to make the game available on some of your favorite internet video destinations such as Netflix and Youtube.

When the extension is installed, a mustache will appear in your browser bar.  Clicking on this mustache will activate the game and 3 mustaches will be placed within your browser window.  At this point, the game has begun. Enjoy!


To-do List

	• Allow players to select their mustache styles
	• Allow players to position their mustaches
